    <h1>My Skills and Experiences</h1>
    <h2>What my Unique Perspective Could Bring to Software Development</h2>
    <div class="container1">
        <p>
            My college career has been nothing short of exciting, and I have had countless opportunities to explore the world and myself. I decided to study psychology with a plan to attend graduate school to become a counselor or clinical psychologist. However, I discovered my passion for software engineering and decided I that this is what I could see myself doing as a career when I graduate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Though my time learning web development only goes back to November or December of 2022, when I first started exploring my options, I feel that I have learned a lot and that I will continue to accumulate knowledge and skills over the next few months leading into what I hope to be an opportunity to use my new skills in the real world.
        </p>
        <ul class="dev-skills">Over this time I've learned a number of web development skills from a variety of resources:
            <li>Intermediate HTML and CSS from freeCodeCamp</li>
            <li>Beginner-level JavaScript from freeCodeCamp, JavaScript 30, and other tutorials</li>
            <li>An understanding of GitHub from building projects and finding ways to store, edit, and push them.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="soft-skills">While my area of study doesn't appear to align with my current goals, I believe I have learned a lot of valuable skills from studying psychology and from getting a college education in general:
            <li>Analytical skills from research</li>
            <li>Problem solving related to thinking about treatment options and overcoming research obstacles</li>
            <li>Commitment to long-term (several-year) projects</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="container2">
        <h2>My Plan Going Forward</h2>
        <p>
            Of course to have made such a drastic change in my career direction encourages the question of what I imagined myself doing when I chose to commit to this path. To be truthful, I have a passion for psychology and am an advocate for mental health, but learned from my experiences that I would prefer to make a difference from behind the scenes. My <span class="dream-job">dream job would be to develop mental health apps and software, as that would combine both of my passions.</span> I realized as I researched that there is so much you can do and create with software development that there really is a place for everyone, from every perspective. I truly believe that my background in psychology is going to serve me well in this field and I hope that things will come full circle and I will one day be able to combine both worlds.

            For now, while I am still developing my skills, I plan to focus on honing my JavaScript skills. I am working on some projects that will help me practice. Beyond that, I plan to begin learning some front end frameworks by the spring or summer, and then perhaps another language such as python or PHP if I decide to learn full stack skills. While I have ambitious plans that I am excited about, I am more than happy to pursue whatever skills will be most helpful for the company or people I am working with.
