                Hello, and thank you for stopping by my website! My name is McKenna. I am a self-taught web developer who is finishing up my bachelor's degree in psychology! I entered the world of programming in November 2022 when I discovered my passion for the behind-the-scenes aspects of my field, especially those that come in the form of mental health apps and software. I have been learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on freeCodeCamp.com, on top of other resources. I have used my new skills to build some projects of my own, including the website you are visiting right now, and would love the opportunity to work with a team of other developers in my first ever professional coding job! Feel free to check out some of the projects I have been working on in the "projects" tab above. Thank you and I look forward to meeting you!
